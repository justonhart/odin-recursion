# About
This project is part of the JavaScript module in the Odin Project.

### Fibonacci Sequence generator implementations
* fibs.js is an iterative implementation of a Fibonacci sequence generator.
* fibsRec.js is a recursive implementation of a Fibonacci sequence generator. I made an improvement after my initial commit, review the commit history to see my first implementation.
* fibsRec-chatgpt.js is ChatGPT's implementation of a recursive Fibonacci sequence generator.

### Merge sort
